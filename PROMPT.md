# What is Eurobot

Eurobot is a modern international robotics competition where student and amateur teams build fully autonomous robots to complete themed tasks on a standardized game table. Each year brings a new challenge, and teams face off in 1-on-1 matches lasting 100 seconds. Robots operate entirely without human intervention, using sensors and pre-programmed logic to score points. The competition emphasizes innovation, strategy, and teamwork, with national qualifiers leading to an international final featuring participants from over 15 countries.
