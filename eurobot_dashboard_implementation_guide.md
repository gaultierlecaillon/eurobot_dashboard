- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly interface that works on all devices

## Technology Stack

### Core Framework
- **React 18+**: Component-based UI library
- **Next.js 13+**: React framework with server-side rendering and routing

### UI Components
- **Chakra UI**: Comprehensive component library with responsive design capabilities
- **Framer Motion**: Animation library for smooth transitions

### Data Visualization
- **Recharts**: React-based charting library for interactive visualizations

### Data Management
- **React Query**: Library for data fetching, caching, and state management
- **Papa Parse**: CSV parsing library for browser-based applications

### Development Tools
- **TypeScript**: For type safety and better developer experience
- **ESLint/Prettier**: Code quality and formatting
- **Jest/React Testing Library**: Testing framework

```

## Data Models

The application uses three main data models:

### Match

```typescript
interface Match {
  matchNumber: number;
  matchId: string;
  team1: {
    name: string;
    id: string;
    score: number;
  };
  team2: {
    name: string;
    id: string;
    score: number;
  };
  winner: string; // team1, team2, or draw
  series: number; // 1, 2, or 3
}
```

### Team Ranking

```typescript
interface TeamRanking {
  position: number;
  name: string;
  standId: string;
  country: string;
  totalPoints: number;
  matchesPlayed: number;
  wins: number;
  draws: number;
  losses: number;
  series: number; // 1, 2, or 3
}
```

### Team Performance

```typescript
interface TeamPerformance {
  name: string;
  standId: string;
  country: string;
  matches: Match[];
  rankings: {
    series1?: TeamRanking;
    series2?: TeamRanking;
    series3?: TeamRanking;
  };
  totalPoints: number;
  averagePoints: number;
}
```

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Project Setup

```bash
# Create Next.js app with TypeScript
npx create-next-app@latest eurobot_dashboard --typescript

# Navigate to project directory
cd eurobot_dashboard

# Install dependencies
npm install @chakra-ui/react @emotion/react @emotion/styled framer-motion
npm install recharts react-query papaparse
npm install @types/papaparse --save-dev

# Create project structure
mkdir -p components/{layout,matches,teams,visualizations}
mkdir -p pages/{matches,teams}
mkdir -p utils types public/data styles
```

### 2. Data Preparation

1. Copy the CSV files to the `public/data` directory
2. Create the data types in `types/dataTypes.ts`
3. Implement the data parsing utilities in `utils/dataParser.ts`

### 3. Core Components

#### Layout Components

1. Create a responsive layout with header and footer
2. Implement navigation between different sections
3. Add theme support for light and dark modes

#### Match Components

1. Implement the MatchCard component for displaying match information
2. Create the MatchList component for displaying a grid of matches
3. Develop the MatchDetails component for showing detailed match information

#### Team Components

1. Implement the TeamCard component for displaying team information
2. Create the TeamRankings component for showing team rankings
3. Develop the TeamDetails component for showing detailed team information

### 4. Data Visualization

1. Implement the TeamPerformanceChart component for visualizing team performance
2. Create the SeriesComparison component for comparing results across series
3. Add interactive elements to the charts for better user experience

### 5. Pages

#### Home Page

1. Implement the dashboard overview with summary statistics
2. Add visualizations of top-performing teams
3. Include sections for recent matches and top teams

#### Matches Page

1. Create a list view of all matches with filtering options

3. Add a detailed view for individual teams

### 6. Responsive Design

1. Use Chakra UI's responsive props for adaptive layouts
2. Implement mobile-first design principles
3. Test on various screen sizes and devices

### 7. Testing and Deployment

1. Write unit tests for critical components
2. Perform end-to-end testing of the application
3. Optimize for production and deploy to a hosting platform

## Sample Components

The `sample_components` directory contains examples of how the key components would be implemented:

- `MatchCard.tsx`: Displays match information in a card format
- `MatchesPage.tsx`: Shows a list of matches with filtering options
- `HomePage.tsx`: Main dashboard with summary statistics and recent matches
- `TeamPerformanceChart.tsx`: Visualizes team performance across series
- `types/dataTypes.ts`: TypeScript interfaces for the data models
- `utils/dataParser.ts`: Utilities for parsing CSV data

These components demonstrate the structure and functionality of the application and can be used as a starting point for implementation.

## Design Considerations

### Responsive Design

The application uses a mobile-first approach with the following breakpoints:

- Small: 0-600px (mobile)
- Medium: 600-960px (tablet)
- Large: 960-1280px (desktop)
- Extra Large: 1280px+ (large desktop)

### Accessibility

The application follows accessibility best practices:

- Semantic HTML structure
- ARIA attributes for interactive elements
- Keyboard navigation support
- Color contrast compliance
- Screen reader compatibility

### Performance

The application is optimized for performance:

- Code splitting with Next.js
- React.memo for expensive components
- Virtualized lists for large datasets
- Optimized images with Next.js Image component
- Proper caching strategies with React Query

## Conclusion
